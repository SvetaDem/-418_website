                "Minecraft has probably made the biggest change in my life so far, making me more social and even more famous in some ways. 
                It's weird that Marcus Persson was prancing around in a chat room I used to attend and mentioned to me that he liked my music. 
                The sandbox game he was developing interested me. And by golly, now I'm working on one of the most successful indie games of this year!"
